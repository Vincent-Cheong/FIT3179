                        <p>African countries are clustered more closely and have lower recoveries and deaths compared to others. The Americas have more countries with higher death-recovery ratios. The rest of the continents average around 1k deaths and 10k recoveries. With decreased social gatherings and more precautions taken, hopefully the countries can stay in higher positions in recoveries (nearer to the top) and lower positions in deaths (nearer to the left).</p>

                    <p>The Americas sustained most cases as a whole but is also due to America's cases skewing the reading up, despite having better healthcare policies. The African region notably has lowest average case - the continent of a billion people had fewer deaths than most other countries despite generally fragile health systems. Other regions have a reasonable number of average cases. While some countries are wealthier or equipped with better healthcare, overall the figures are within the expected range.</p>

                    <p>The line graph on the right is divided into two parts: one for categoric cases and the other for number of countries.</p>
                    <p>Note: hover around for more details</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The graph of categoric cases may seem out of shape or skewed but it is a clear picture of how the outbreak escalated. Up until 20th March, the line seems to be very low because the rise in cases was steady.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, the line graph increases exponentially. The virus quickly spread to many more people in such a short time. While deaths and active cases rose setadily, recoveries went up higher mostly due to precautions taken and intensive medical assistance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We can see that the number of countries infected were small up until around March. Most of the countries became infected from there onwards.</p>
                    <p>Many countries contracted the virus because of air, ground, and sea travels which were too late to stop in the early stages. However, with more awareness and decreased outdoor activities, deaths and active cases were kept on a slow increase.</p>

                    <p>Compared to recoveries, a smaller area covered in the graph of deaths per 100 cases is good news. The area for deaths per 100 recoveries is almost the same as the deaths per 100 cases. This shows that the recoveries is almost as many as confirmed cases. Hopefully, with sustained precaution, we may be able to further control the outbreak of this virus.</p>
